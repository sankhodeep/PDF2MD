Role: You are an expert medical educator and a question creation specialist for competitive exams like NEET PG and INICET.

Your Goal: Your primary objective is to generate a set of high-yield, conceptually sound, and stylistically accurate multiple-choice questions based on the provided content and examples.

[INPUT SECTION 1: CORE CONTENT]

Here is the structured Markdown content for a specific topic . You must base your questions primarily on this content.

{{INSERT_MARKDOWN_CONTENT_HERE}}

[INPUT SECTION 2: TOPIC-SPECIFIC EXAMPLES]

Here are 4 real PYQs that have appeared from this specific topic. Pay close attention to their structure, language, and the concepts they test.

[INPUT SECTION 3: GENERAL STYLE GUIDE]

Here are 25 random PYQs from the entire Community Medicine subject. Do not base your questions on the content of these, but use them to understand the overall style, tone, difficulty, and pattern of questions asked in the exam. This is your "style guide".

[INSTRUCTION SECTION: YOUR TASK]

Now, follow these instructions precisely to generate the questions:

Analyze First: Before writing, deeply analyze all three input sections. Understand the core concepts from the content, the specific patterns from the topic examples, and the general 'vibe' from the style guide.

Comprehensive Coverage: Generate as many  high-quality questions as you need  that comprehensively cover the provided content. content. The goal is that if a student can answer all your generated questions, they should be able to tackle any question from this topic in the actual exam.

Mimic the Style: Your questions must strictly mimic the style, tone, and difficulty level of the provided PYQ examples. Create a mix of question types: clinical vignettes, image-based scenarios (based on the image descriptions in the Markdown), one-liners, application-based questions, and any other novel question formats that you deduce might appear in future exams based on your analysis of the provided examples.

Plausible Distractors: For each question, the incorrect options (distractors) must be plausible and relevant to the topic. They should test a student's deeper understanding, not just superficial knowledge.

No Simple Definitions: Avoid asking simple definitional questions like "What is a case series?". Instead, create scenarios where the student has to identify the concept.

Output Format: Your final output must be a single, clean JSON array. Each object in the array should represent one question and follow this exact structure:

[
  {
    "question_text": "The full text of the question.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Option A text.",
      "B": "Option B text.",
      "C": "Option C text.",
      "D": "Option D text."
    },
    "correct_option": "A",
    "explanation": "A clear and concise explanation of why the correct option is right and the others are wrong.",
    "image_based": false,
    "difficulty": "Medium"
  },
  {
    "question_text": "Another question...",
    "options": {...},
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "...",
    "image_based": true,
    "difficulty": "Hard"
  }
